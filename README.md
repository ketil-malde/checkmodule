# Checking components

Contents:

- `check.py`: check a component
- `checkall.sh`: check all components in `modules.txt`
- `modules.txt`: list of components (git repositories)

## Examples

`Data.py`, `Model.py`, and `Project.py` are skeleton code for how the
three types of components can (should) be structured.  Any component
repository should only provide one of these.
